A intelligent LeetCode buddy to make you a Leetcode Master. Buddy has a plan with 170+ problems across 3 phases and buddy also helps you track your solutions and patterns covered for easy revision. The project allows you to submit the leetcode solutions, uses Gemini AI to enrich your submission with metadata and commits them directly to GitHub. Built on Netlify serverless functions, the app also classifies each solution by pattern, generate approach summaries, infer time/space complexity, surface key insights and gotchas, and auto-flag problems for revisit based on self-rating.
